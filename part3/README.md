# Part 3

My solutions to [Devops with Docker - part 3](https://devopswithdocker.com/part3/)




## Exercise 3.1

* Take the backend/frontend images, and make smaller.

In exercise 1.12 I'd already made images for the front-end and back-end, so copied those as a starting point:

```
$ cd ex3.1/
$ docker build -f Dockerfile.back.orig  -t backend .
$ docker build -f Dockerfile.front.orig -t front .
```

After doing that I see the following image-sizes:

| File                  | Image     | Size  |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----- |
| Dockerfile.back.orig  | backend   | 411MB |
| Dockerfile.front.orig | front     | 590MB |

(Via `docker image ls`)

With the new Dockerfiles present in [ex3.1/](ex3.1/) I managed to achieve a __small__ amount of space-saving:


| File                  | Image     | Size  | Saving |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ |
| Dockerfile.back       | backend   | 588Mb |    2Mb |
| Dockerfile.fron       | front     | 408Mb |    3Mb |

The changes were simple enough:

* Join together the various shell-commands to remove layers.
* Purge `git-core` / `curl` after they're used.
* Remove the `apt` state-files.
* Remove `.git/` contents from the repository we cloned.

**NOTE**: For sneaky extra points I could do something like `rm -rf /usr/share/doc`, but that felt like cheating.




# Exercise 3.2

* Letâ€™s create our first deployment pipeline!

I logged into heroku, and created a new application named `dwd-pipeline`
(dwd -> devops with docker, used the same prefix in part2).

Using their console I configured commits from github to be deployed to production.  Making a commit and push resulted in a working application.

```
frodo ~/Repos/github.com/skx/httpd $ git push heroku master
Counting objects: 29, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (28/28), done.

Total 29 (delta 10), reused 0 (delta 0)

remote:

 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

The end result is that pushes to github, or directly to the heroku origin (as defined in `.git/config`) trigger a deployment.

The application is visible here:

* https://dwd-pipeline.herokuapp.com/




# Exercise 3.3

* Build an image within docker.

OK this was a fun one.  The core goal is:

* Take a Github URL
* Clone that, and build the docker file in the root
* Tag it and push to dockerhub.

I created a pair of files:

* [ex3.3/builder](ex3.3/builder)
  * The script that builds the image.
  * It installs `git` and `docker`.
* [ex3.3/Dockerfile](ex3.3/Dockerfile)
  * The dockerfile to create an image of that

Build the builder:

```
frodo ~/x/part3/ex3.3 $ docker build -t builder .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB
..
```

Login to dockerhub on the host:

```
frodo ~/x/part3/ex3.3 $ docker login --username=stevekemp
Password:
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/skx/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store
```

Now launch it to build the image, note that we map two things:

* The docker-socket.
* The docker `config.json` file, so that the push works.


```
$ docker run -ti -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
                 -v /home/skx/.docker/config.json:/root/.docker/config.json \
                 builder:latest https://github.com/skx/httpd.git

You'll then find the result here:

  * Of course no documentation.

```

From there we can clean all our images, and confirm that fetching/running works:

```

# Exercise 3.4

* Run our front-end and back-end images as a non-root user.

Updated dockerfiles contained in [ex3.4/](ex3.4/), with two changes:

* Added the user to run the server `adduser server`
* Added the `USER server` to the dockerfile to make that user run later commands.

**NOTE**:

* It would have been better to run the `git clone ..`, and similar commands, as the user.  However installing git would have required root, or sudo.
* I was mostly thinking of the run-time due to bugs in the application, I assume we can trust the system & NPM packages (ha).
* Plus adding these commands at the end allow me to reuse the cached image(s) from ex3.1 :)




# Exercise 3.5

* Use the NodeJS base image instead for our front-end and back-end images.

Resulting dockerfiles contained in [ex3.5/](ex3.5/)

Initial sizes after ex3.4:

| Image  | Size  |
| ------ | ----- |
| front  | 781MB |
| backend| 434MB |

After changing the base to `node:alpine` they become:

| Image  | Size  |  Saving |
| ------ | ----- | ------- |
| front  | 346Mb |   435Mb |
| backend| 166MB |   268Mb |


* I didn't need to install node, obviously.
  * Still added, & removed, `git` to clone the projects.
* I still added the `server` user for both images, and make them run under it.
  * This time I ran the `chown` before the npm install.
  * **NOTE**: Had to change the adduser, via reference:
    * https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/38



# Exercise 3.6

* Lets do a multi-stage build for the frontend project since weâ€™ve come so far with the application.

The Dockerfile can be found in [ex3.6/](ex3.6/), which largely does the same setup as previously, but then copies the `dist/` contents into place.

I made sure I readded the user to run the server, for completeness.

```
frodo $ docker build -t front-new .
Sending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB
..
```

The new/final size is `127Mb`:

```
$ docker image ls front-new | awk '{print $NF}' | tail -n1
127MB

```


# Exercise 3.7

* Do all or most of the optimizations from security to size for any other Dockerfile you have access to.

In my case I'll use the [http-server](https://github.com/skx/httpd) I hacked up, which has a Dockerfile published for [exercise 1.15](https://github.com/skx/devopswithdocker.com/tree/master/part1#exercise-115).

Since this is a Golang binary we can build it nice and neatly via just copying the binary.

* [ex3.7/](ex3.7/) contains the Dockerfile

The size is small:

```
frodo ~/x/part3 $ docker image ls | head -n2
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
httpd               latest              fb3823d6dc78        29 seconds ago       122MB
```

The image has a dedicated `server`-user which launches the application.

This image _could_ have been smaller there was the issue of deploying the binary with libc/library differences so the run-time layer is Debian Buster to match the golang-based build-layer.  (i.e. This failed when I ran on alpine.)



# Exercise 3.8

* Diagram drawing.
